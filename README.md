MyToken - 
Overview
This Solidity contract allows you to create your own custom token. While it wonâ€™t be a real cryptocurrency, it demonstrates the essential features of a token, including minting and burning functions.

Description
The MyToken contract provides the following functionalities:

Token Details: It stores the name, abbreviation, and total supply of your custom token.
Balances: It maintains a mapping of addresses to their token balances.
Minting: You can mint (create) new tokens by increasing the total supply and adding tokens to an address.
Burning: You can burn (destroy) tokens by decreasing the total supply and deducting tokens from an address.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install a Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).
Deploy the MyToken contract on a testnet or local blockchain.

Example
// Deploy the contract with initial supply
MyToken myToken = new MyToken("My Custom Token", "MCT", 1000000);

// Mint new tokens
myToken.mint(address1, 1000);
myToken.mint(address2, 500);

// Burn tokens
myToken.burn(address1, 200);
myToken.burn(address2, 100);
